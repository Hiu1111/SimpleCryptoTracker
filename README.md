# **PROJECT: Cryptocurrency Portfolio Tracker**

## **This project tracks live cryptocurrency prices using the Flask framework and the CoinGecko API**

**Homepage**
  - Simply displays a welcome message

**Cryptocurrencypage**
  - Fetches live prices of bitcoin and ethereum from the CoinGecko API
  - Displays the prices using HTML

**Note:**
  - Flask, used for creating the web application 
  - Requests, used for fetching cryptocurrency data from the CoinGecko API

## I plan to add more features and functionality to this project in the future, as I am still learning more about web development, API integration, database management, and creating user-friendly interfaces. As I expand my skills, I aim to enhance this project with a portfolio tracker, notification systems and etc.
